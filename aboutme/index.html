    <p>Howdy everyone, allow me to introduce myself. I hail from Delta State, Nigeria, but presently, I call Lagos, Nigeria, my home. I'm single and currently employed in an educational institution in Africa. During my free time, I find joy in playing and watching soccer, and I have a deep passion for staying updated with the latest in technology.</p>
    <p>My journey is directed towards a degree in software development at BYU-Idaho. I greatly value the flexibility offered by BYU-Idaho's online programs and the enriching learning experiences they provide. My goal is to harness these skills to unlock new career opportunities, specializing in website and web application development. Thanks for getting to know me!</p>
